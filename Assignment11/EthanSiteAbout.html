				<h2>Project 1</h2>
				<p>Hi my name is Ethan Miller, and I am majoring in Game Design.  I was born on September 18, 2002. I lived in East Alton, IL for 17-18 years. I have two brothers, an older brother named Jordan and an identical twin named Nathan. I was Vice-President of Student Council in High School and was top 15% of my class during my Senior Year.  My favorite video games include first person shooters, strategy games, and sports games. </p>
